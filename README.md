## üåç About the Project

**Rent-A-Basket** is a Chrome browser extension that transforms the traditional Walmart online shopping experience by promoting eco-friendly alternatives through **rent-based product suggestions**.

The project reimagines sustainable consumer behavior by embedding a new action button ‚Äî **‚ÄúRent Instead (Eco)‚Äù** ‚Äî directly on Walmart product pages. When clicked, users are presented with environmentally-conscious product suggestions and rental options using AI-generated recommendations.

## üõí How It Works (User Experience Flow)

1. **Shop as Usual on Walmart**  
   The user visits [walmart.com](https://www.walmart.com) and browses products as they normally would.

2. **See Helpful Popups Appear Automatically**  
   - A **‚ÄúRent Instead (Eco)‚Äù** button popup appears near the product image or price.  
   - At the same time, a small **Wall-E chatbot window** appears in the corner of the page.

3. **Start a Conversation with Wall-E Chatbot**  
   - The chatbot proactively asks the user:
     > "Would you like to see more sustainable or rent-friendly alternatives for this product?"  
   - The user can reply based on their preferences, for example:
     - "Yes, show me reusable options"
     - "Are there eco-friendly rentals?"
     - "I prefer bamboo or compostable materials"

4. **Get Smart Recommendations**  
   Wall-E analyzes the product the user is viewing and provides:
   - AI-powered eco-friendly suggestions  
   - Actual Walmart product links with more sustainable options  
   - Explanations on why those products are better for the environment  

5. **Explore New Product Options**  
   - When the user clicks on any of the suggested Walmart links, they are taken to a new product page.
   - Wall-E remains available to chat on every page, ready to assist further.

6. **Use the ‚ÄúRent Instead (Eco)‚Äù Button**  
   - If the user is still interested in renting the product instead of buying, they can click the **‚ÄúRent Instead (Eco)‚Äù** button.

7. **View Rent-A-Basket Popup**  
   - This opens a clean popup window that includes:
     - **Terms & Conditions** for rental
     - **Price breakdown** comparing buying vs. renting
     - **Environmental impact facts** on how renting reduces waste
     - **Final CTA** to proceed with the rental or view even more sustainable alternatives

8. **Make an Informed, Eco-Friendly Choice**  
   - Users can now choose whether to rent, buy a sustainable option, or learn more.
   - Either way, they‚Äôve made a smarter decision for themselves and the planet üåç.
